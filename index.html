                    <p>Working with Professor Hsiao-Wen Chen at the University of Chicago,
                        I am currently trying to use quasar absorption spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope to constrain 
                        the complex, multi-phase circumgalactic gas around galaxies at z~1. I then try to identify hosts for 
                        absorbers found along the quasar line of sight using spectroscopic follow-ups of surrounding galaxies
                        using the Very Large and Magellan Telescopes. This multi-pronged approach allows us to constrain the
                        origin of the circumgalactic gas at the redshift range of interest.</p>

                    <p>Working with Professor Matthew Malkan at UCLA,
                        I examined coronal line emissions in a hundred million SDSS quasars to understand trends of 
                        coronal line emission and identified a new addition to the small class of seven known
                        Coronal Line Forest (CLiF) AGNs.</p>

                    <p> Working with Professor Matthew Malkan, I reduced far-IR IFUs of about 37 galaxies observed by SOFIA. Our findings are publised

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Teaching and Beyond</h2>
                    <p>I currently have two quarters of experience as a teaching assistant in the 
                        Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. I have had several experiences in informal teaching before,
                        most notably being involved in a departmental club at UCLA meant to train undergraduates for research opportunities in physics.
                        I believe in learning from my students just as much as they would like to learn from me - I am always looking for ways to 
                        better reach my audience, and make my discussions a safe, welcoming, and engaging space.</p>

                    <p>That said, I realize that a variety of backgrounds that students come from can pose significant challenges to their learning.
                        This has historically been an obstacle for the engagement of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM. I am committed
                        to learning more about the different experiences of communities within astronomy and physics as well as STEM in general. </p>

                    <p> I am also looking to be more involved in outreach opportunities to promote a healthy mindset of thinking about science among
                        children in schools. In the future, I wish to make an impact on the experiences of undergraduates and graduate students
                        within research-based departments.</p>
